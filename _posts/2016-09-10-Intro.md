In [Part 0]({{site.url}}/Reductor-prologue/) we made simple TODO application using immutable state and self-written state container. 
We found that mutable data structures can lead to uncontrolled data changes that could be the root of the unpredictable behaviour.
After some code changes, we showed that mutations can be avoided by keeping only one immutable object with mutable reference.

In this article, we will cover how Redux can help with this problem and reimplement our application using Reductor.

Here is our TodoStore (class that manage the state) we end up with last time:

```java
public class TodoStore {
    public interface StateListener {
        void onStateChanged();
    }

    private List<TodoItem> todoItems = TreePVector.empty();

    private List<StateListener> listeners = new ArrayList<>();

    public List<TodoItem> getTodoItems() {
        return todoItems;
    }

    public void addItem(TodoItem item) {
        todoItems = addItem(todoItems, item);
        notifyListeners();
    }

    public void changeState(long id, boolean isChecked) {
        todoItems = changeState(todoItems, id, isChecked);
        notifyListeners();
    }

    @VisibleForTesting
    static List<TodoItem> addItem(List<TodoItem> items, TodoItem item) {
        return TreePVector.from(items)
                .plus(item);
    }

    @VisibleForTesting
    static List<TodoItem> changeState(List<TodoItem> items, long id, boolean isChecked) {
        for (int i = 0; i < items.size(); i++) {
            TodoItem todoItem = items.get(i);
            if (todoItem.id == id) {
                TodoItem changed = new TodoItem(id, todoItem.text, isChecked);
                return TreePVector.from(items)
                        .with(i, changed);
            }
        }
        return items;
    }

    private void notifyListeners() {
        for (StateListener listener : listeners) {
            listener.onStateChanged();
        }
    }

    public void addListener(StateListener listener) {
        listeners.add(listener);
    }
}
```

# Redux and Reductor

This "Store" pattern looks nice for a particular case.
It can help to isolate mutations and make state change testable.
But how can we reuse it and decrease the amount of boilerplate code needed every time we want to add and manage any new dataset.
And that's where [Redux](redux.js.org) and [Reductor](https://github.com/Yarikx/reductor) will help us. 

Reductor is a minimalistic library that reimplements Redux (Javascript library for state management) in Java. 
It was created with Android in mind but can be used in any Java application. 
The main idea is to embrace the power of immutable data structures and functional composition to provide a sophisticated approach to developing rich client-side applications. 

Here is how Redux works (from [here](http://arqex.com/1087/using-redux-devtools-without-redux)):

![Redux dataflow](http://arqex.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/redux.png)

The whole idea is really simple: 

* `Store` object holds and maintains the state
* To change the state application can _dispatch_ actions to `Store`
* For each action `Store` compute *new state* using pure function _f(s, a)_ (called `reducer`)
* `Store` replace current state with *new state*

And that's it! Though it looks elementary this approach is really powerful.
To illustrate this will reimplement our TODO application using this approach with Reductor.
But don't worry, there will be not so many changes from our original example.

So, let's start!

## Installation
First of all, we need to add Reductor as a dependency.
Follow [Installation](https://github.com/Yarikx/reductor#installation) for more details. 

When added, `Store`, `Reducer` and `Action` classes should be available in the classpath.

## Defining the shape state.

Before writing any code, we need to choose how our state should look like. 
As we only need to store a list of `TodoItem`, for our simple example that will be `List<TodoItem>`.

You may wonder: What if we need to store not a single object but a few of them? 
Can I store 2, 3 or 42 objects with different types in `Store`? -- Yes and No.

`Store` is designed to store one particular state object of the arbitrary type. 
However what we can do is to compose several "substates" into one object. 
We will talk about how to do this in the next article.

## Defining actions 
As said before, we ~~mutate~~ change our state by dispatching actions.
Actions are dispatched by _actioin type_ -- string identifier that denotes the action which will be applied to the state.

We can define them just as constants.

```java
public class TodoActions {
    public static final String ADD_ITEM = "ADD_ITEM";
    public static final String CHANGE_STATE = "CHANGE_STATE";
}
```

However, to handle an action we need a bit more information than just a name.
That's why in Reductor `Action` is predefined type with two fields:

```java
public class Action {
    public final String type;
    public final Object value;

    public Action(String type, Object value) {...}
}
```

* `type` is String action type we just defined above
* `value` is payload you can attach to an action if necessary 

Additionally, we can define _action creators_ -- helper functions to create actions.
This step is not required but is strongly suggested to keep code clean.

```java
public class TodoActions {
    public static final String ADD_ITEM = "ADD_ITEM";
    public static final String CHANGE_STATE = "CHANGE_STATE";
    
    public static Action addItem(TodoItem item) {
        return new Action(ADD_ITEM, item);
    }
    
    public static Action changeState(long id, boolean isChecked) {
        return new Action(CHANGE_STATE, Pair.create(id, isChecked));
    }
}
```

Basically, that's our contract. We defined all possible operations we can perform with a state.

## Reducer

As we defined actions, we need to define the way we will react to them.
To do this we need to implement `Reducer` interface.

```java
public interface Reducer<State> {
    State reduce(State state, Action action);
}
```

So the idea is really simple behind this signature.
You define a pure function (method) `reduce` that will apply an action to a state to compute a new state.

```java
public class TodoReducer implements Reducer<List<TodoItem>> {

    List<TodoItem> addItem(List<TodoItem> items, TodoItem item) {
        return TreePVector.from(items)
                .plus(item);
    }

    List<TodoItem> changeState(List<TodoItem> items, long id, boolean isChecked) {
        for (int i = 0; i < items.size(); i++) {
            TodoItem todoItem = items.get(i);
            if (todoItem.id == id) {
                TodoItem changed = new TodoItem(id, todoItem.text, isChecked);
                return TreePVector.from(items)
                        .with(i, changed);
            }
        }
        return items;
    }
    
    @Override
    public List<TodoItem> reduce(List<TodoItem> items, Action action) {
        switch (action.type) {
            case TodoActions.ADD_ITEM:
                TodoItem todoItem = (TodoItem) action.value;
                return addItem(items, todoItem);

            case TodoActions.CHANGE_STATE:
                Pair<Long, Boolean> pair = (Pair<Long, Boolean>) action.value;
                long id = pair.first;
                boolean isChecked = pair.second;
                return changeState(items, id, isChecked);

            default:
                return items;
        }
    }
}
```

Let's check what we have here:

* Two pure functions that perform particular actions (copied from our original implementation)
* Method `reduce` that takes our state and action. This method does a few things:
    - Dispatch the action by switching on `action.type`
    - Extract payload per each action if necessary
    - Compute new state and return it
    - Return the previous state if action is not dispatched (`action.type` is unknown for this Reducer) 

We defined our state reducer. 
As you can see we still keep the principle of using only pure functions to compute a new state.
That means that this class is still well testable.

> Note: our implementation of `reduce` method contain some unsafe operations like type casting. Do not worry about this boilerplate code now, as we will get rid of it using annotations later.

## Using a Store

After we created our Reducer, we can create our state container -- `Store`.

### Creating Store
We do it by calling static method `Store.create`

```java
Store<List<TodoItem>> todoStore = 
        Store.create(new TodoReducer(), Collections.emptyList());
```

`Store.create` takes at least two arguments:

1. State reducer
2. Initial state

### Store API

Once created, `Store` API is really simple: 

```java
public class Store<State> {
    
    public State getState();
    public void dispatch(Object action);
    public Cancelable subscribe(StateChangeListener<State> listener);

    public interface StateChangeListener<S> {
        void onStateChanged(S state);
    }
}

```

* To access a state at any moment method `getState()` is used
* State can be changed by calling `dispatch(action)`
* If necessary, app can register `StateChangeListener` to be notified when state updates by calling `subscribe` method

Having this in mind we can rewrite our MainActivity:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    Store<List<TodoItem>> todoStore;
    TodoAdapter adapter;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        //boilerplate code
        ...
        
        //Creating Store object with empty list as initial state
        todoStore = Store.create(new TodoReducer(), Collections.emptyList());
        todoStore.subscribe(state -> adapter.notifyDataSetChanged());
    }

    void addNote(String text) {
        TodoItem todoItem = new TodoItem(generateId(), text, false);
        todoStore.dispatch(TodoActions.addItem(todoItem));
    }

    void changeState(long id, boolean isChecked) {
        todoStore.dispatch(TodoActions.changeState(id, isChecked));
    }
}
```

As you can see changes are minimal. The structure is the same.
The main difference is action dispatching.

# Reducing boilerplate

As you can see, to create state container we only need to define two things: Reducer and actions.
However, as I mentioned before, there is a bit of 'untyped' code in reducer and in action creators.
This is because we want to pack different data types into the `Action.value`. Here is our Reducer again:

```java
public class TodoReducer implements Reducer<List<TodoItem>> {

    List<TodoItem> addItem(List<TodoItem> items, TodoItem item) {
        return TreePVector.from(items)
                .plus(item);
    }

    List<TodoItem> changeState(List<TodoItem> items, long id, boolean isChecked) {
        for (int i = 0; i < items.size(); i++) {
            TodoItem todoItem = items.get(i);
            if (todoItem.id == id) {
                TodoItem changed = new TodoItem(id, todoItem.text, isChecked);
                return TreePVector.from(items)
                        .with(i, changed);
            }
        }
        return items;
    }
    
    @Override
    public List<TodoItem> reduce(List<TodoItem> items, Action action) {
        switch (action.type) {
            case TodoActions.ADD_ITEM:
                //not typesafe
                TodoItem todoItem = (TodoItem) action.value;
                return addItem(items, todoItem);

            case TodoActions.CHANGE_STATE:
                //not typesafe
                Pair<Long, Boolean> pair = (Pair<Long, Boolean>) action.value;
                long id = pair.first;
                boolean isChecked = pair.second;
                return changeState(items, id, isChecked);

            default:
                return items;
        }
    }
}
```

But actually, if we decompose the logic of `reduce` method into sub-methods per each action (as we did before), the logic of `reduce` becomes really straightforward. 

So why do we need to write it every time? 
Let computer do it for us! 
And that is why Reductor contains ~~Magic~~ Annotation processor.

First, we need to ensure that `reductor-processor` dependency is added. 
Follow [Installation](https://github.com/Yarikx/reductor#installation) for more information.

Then we need to simplify `TodoReducer` as followed:

```java
@AutoReducer
public abstract class TodoReducer implements Reducer<List<TodoItem>> {

    @AutoReducer.Action(TodoActions.ADD_ITEM)
    List<TodoItem> addItem(List<TodoItem> items, TodoItem item) {
        return TreePVector.from(items)
                .plus(item);
    }

    @AutoReducer.Action(TodoActions.CHANGE_STATE)
    List<TodoItem> changeState(List<TodoItem> items, long id, boolean isChecked) {
        for (int i = 0; i < items.size(); i++) {
            TodoItem todoItem = items.get(i);
            if (todoItem.id == id) {
                TodoItem changed = new TodoItem(id, todoItem.text, isChecked);
                return TreePVector.from(items)
                        .with(i, changed);
            }
        }
        return items;
    }

    //note: no reduce method. It will be generated in TodoReducerImpl

    public static TodoReducer create() {
        return new TodoReducerImpl(); //using generated class
    }
}
```

What did we do here?:

* Made class abstract and removed 'reduce' method. 
Reductor processor will generate an implementation of `reduce` method in child `TodoReducerImpl` class.
* Annotated class with `@AutoReducer` annotation.
* Annotated each action method with `@AutoReducer.Action` and provided Action type as annotation value
* Added static factory method `create` to instantiate generated class

Nice! Our code is clean and fancy. All the boilerplate is written by a machine.
But that's only the half of the story. 
What about action creators? Reductor generates them too!

This full generated class out of our Reducer:

```java
public class TodoReducerImpl extends TodoReducer {
  @Override
  public List<TodoItem> reduce(List<TodoItem> state, Action action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case "ADD_ITEM":
        return addItem(state, (TodoItem) action.value);
      case "CHANGE_STATE": {
        Object[] args = (Object[]) action.value;
        return changeState(state, (long) args[0], (boolean) args[1]);
      }
      default: return state;
    }
  }

  public static class ActionCreator {
    public static Action addItem(TodoItem item) {
      return new Action("ADD_ITEM", item);
    }

    public static Action changeState(long id, boolean isChecked) {
      Object[] args = new Object[]{id, isChecked};
      return new Action("CHANGE_STATE", args);
    }
  }
}
```

Now our actions and Reducer are type-safe, even though all of them are dispatched as `Action` objects.

# Conclusion

In this article, we used Reductor library to implement our TODO example app. 
The main interaction point is `Store` object which use user-defined `Reducer` to change the state. 

Reductor library was designed to bring Redux experience into the Java and Android world without sacrificing type safety.
That's why there are such features as auto-generated `@AutoReducer`.

In next article, we will cover how to compose a state and reducers with Reductor.

Stay tuned. _To be continued..._
