# Motivation

As an Android engineer I'm happy to see how this field of software engineering is changing over time. 
Each year our set of tools and approaches evolve and improve.
However there is one particular problem we fight every day, and each time we do it differently.
Today we going to talk about state management.

![State management](https://lukaseder.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/forrest-gump.jpg?w=490&h=381)

Any android application stores and manages some state, either implicitly or explicitly. 
The more data application holds, the harder it gets to understand what's going on. 
Especially when it lives in multithreading asynchronous environment. 

For instance remember how many solutions exist to preserve state across orientation change, and neither of them is ideal.
So are we doomed, or is there a better way? I believe there is at least one!

Another field of software engineering with very similar problems is frontend development. 
Nowadays [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) are client side applications which interact with the user, talk to the server, manage some state and do all of these asynchronously as well as android applications.
So maybe they have some better tools in the toolbox? And it seems like they do.

# [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
![Redux Logo](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f28b5bc7822f1b7bb28a96d8d09e7d79169248fc/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4a65567164514d2e706e67)

Redux is predictable state container for JavaScript apps. Redux can be described in three fundamental principles:

* Single source of truth
* State is read-only
* Changes are made with pure functions

Redux based on ideas both from [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/) and [Elm Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/). It has a big community with a lot of third party extensions, tutorials and examples for a quick start.

If you familiar with Javascript syntax, I strongly recommend reading about the whole idea from nice Redux [documentation](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Motivation.html).
Or you can watch [this 10 minutes video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsuzhTlccRk) by Christina Lee  on how we can adopt some of the web approaches in Android. 

[Reductor](https://github.com/Yarikx/reductor) is basically my reimplementation of Redux in Java.

I'll not focus on how Redux or Reductor is implemented in this article (but I'll do it in next one).
However, for better understanding the problem, I'll provide a simple example here and show how we can improve our code without any of additional tools.

## Learn by example

<div style="text-align: center"><video autoplay='true' loop='true' width='270px' height='480px'><source src='/assets/example.mp4' type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'></video></div>

To show the idea I will use a simple example of Todo list (which is a canonical example in Redux community). 
We will create a simple application with a naive approach (using a lot of mutable states) and then refactor it to make it easier to understand and maintain.

Our Todo app will have few features:

* Displaying a list of Todo items with text and checkbox
* User can add Todo items to list 
* User can change status of each item by switching the checkbox

Note: I'll omit most of the android related boilerplate code to focus only on state management

## Naïve solution
Here is our model definition:

{% gist Yarikx/7676bb77c6f0f03b7111227826b486ba %}

And class which will store and manage Todo items. Let's call it `TodoStore`: 

{% gist Yarikx/aaf088810a514d37deb23c703dc9abe2 %}

As you can see these classes are simple POJO with getters and setters.
Now imagine how client code would look like to work with this state:

{% gist Yarikx/bb47eccdf58ae31c91c662f39a8a8680 %}

![Mutable state](https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/63035823.jpg)

Ok, we have built our first implementation. This code is _simple_ but fragile! Here are few obvious disadvantages:

* Manual adapter notification. In any place we change the state, we need to manually notify adapter 
to reflect changes in UI
* Data can be mutated when we do not expect this
* Not thread safe 
* Hard to test

Let's try to refactor this solution a bit

## State listener
Instead of notifying adapter manually we can create a listener to notify an adapter automatically each time we change the state

{% gist arikx/4080bda9559cb47d1ab589588bbac074 %}

Key changes: 

* Added `StateListener` interface
* Added method `addListener` to register listener for state updates
* Notify all listeners each time we change the state

Now we can remove manual calls to `adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()`

{% gist Yarikx/ff76554fe599a9fe6f1a75430fa410e7 %}

But in fact this code will not work as expected, because we made one bug: 
In `TodoStore` we notify the listeners by calling `setTodoItems`, however, in our `MainActivity` code
we mutate the list we get from `getTodoItems` directly. 
As you can see it's easy to introduce a bug, when working with the mutable state.
Therefore we need to fix it.

{% gist Yarikx/d43345f928681b089f685a28b02b8a98 %}

## Encapsulation
As we saw in the previous example we can still accidentally mutate our data without notifying listeners.
We can fix it by encapsulating all the logic of managing the state inside the `TodoStore`.

{% gist Yarikx/760576ba34210b1234b93394d4605690 %}

{% gist Yarikx/e58b3bb0c2d12e803b103b870d266e3b %}

## Immutability

So now we have no other way to change the state except defined methods in `TodoStore`... Well, almost. We can still
mutate each `TodoItem` and modify List of items received by `getTodoItems()`, let's fix them.

Here is immutable `TodoItem`. Now we can get rid of getters and setters as we have final fields;

{% gist Yarikx/0e7a37d29e7ad2f9699476171c199236 %}

Also, we need to change implementation of `TodoStore` to create new object every time we change the list
Note: instead of copying lists by myself I used [Pcollections](https://github.com/hrldcpr/pcollections) as an implementation of persistent/immutable collections.

{% gist Yarikx/c065a18a295e40786abb51ba0d968b03 %}

Good! Now each time we get List of TODO items, we know that object is immutable, so we can be sure nobody can change it
 out of the contract (methods defined in `TodoStore`). That's already better than our first naive implementation. 
 But we can go even further with that.
 
## Improving testability
 
Our code still has some disadvantages. The main one: this code is not testable enough.
For instance, to test function `changeState` we need to have at least one item in the list, 
so in tests, we need to 'pre-initialize' the state first before calling the function.
Then we need to get list of items via 
`getTodoItems()` to check if it satisfy test conditions.
In our case, it's not possible without additional constructors/methods for test purpose.

But let's take a small step back.
We know that our data is immutable now as we always create new state instead of mutating previous one.
Each time we want to change the state we take current state, compute new state and re-assign the variable. 
What if we extract this computation step as a pure function that takes current state and returns next state.
 
So in result, we will get this structure of `TodoStore`

{% gist Yarikx/8e47905bc56de054ef7b856860fa135d %}

As we can see we extracted logic of transition from old to a new state into pure functions, so they can be tested easily.
In fact, our public functions become pretty similar. All they do now:

* Compute a new state from the old state and additional data passed externally as parameters
* Reassign a state variable
* Notify listeners

# Conclusion

At this point, we can stop refactoring, as this solution is already better than our initial naïve implementation. 
However, we managed to improve state management only for one particular dataset in our application -- list of Todo items.
In real life, our application will manage much more data. So... 

Should we apply this approach for other datasets? -- Yes!

Should we reimplement Store for each dataset? -- No! We can try to generify our solution to use with any data.

But that's not as easy as to extract a type parameter. 
We will work on it in the next part of this series. But if you are curious what we will talk about next time take a look into the implementation 
of [Reductor](https://github.com/Yarikx/reductor).

Stay tuned. _To be continued..._
